1. Further testing of script on HTB where I won't get into trouble.
2. Push limits of PDF document creation. Create new page once reaching a low y_position value.
3. Add further scan techniques sV sC etc and plan to modify results based on scan technique used.
4. Use regex and exceptions to handle malformed input.
5. Possibly make it not look so boring.
6. Think of more ideas to implement to make it useful for documenting scanned results:)
